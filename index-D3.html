          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Healthcare and Poverty</h2>
          <p>Poverty has long been recognized as a contributor to death and 
            disease, but several recent trends have generated an increased 
            focus on the link between income and health. First, income 
            inequality in the United States has increased dramatically in 
            recent decades, while health indicators have plateaued, and life 
            expectancy differences by income have grown.</p>

          <p>Income influences health and longevity through various clinical, 
            behavioral, social, and environmental mechanisms. Isolating the 
            unique contribution of income to health can be difficult because 
            this relationship intersects with many other social risk factors.</p>

          <p>Tobacco use continues to be a major cause of cancer and premature 
            death. Most studies of cigarette smoking and mortality have focused 
            on middle-aged populations, with fewer studies examining the impact 
            of tobacco cessation on disease and mortality risk among the elderly.</p>
